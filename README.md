# Mars Lander Game
Mars Lander Game based on pygame library.

## Introduction:
The Python pygame package is an Open Source library for making multimedia applications and games. It is
built on top of the excellent SDL library, and like that library it is highly portable and runs on nearly every
platform and operating system.

## Documentation, including tutorials and sample code:
https://www.pygame.org/docs/
pygame is excellent for reproducing classic arcade games from the 1970s and 80s, and it has been used to
recreate Pong, Pacman, Snake, Defender, and Asteroids amongst many others.
We introduced pygame in CS1527 Practical 8 and you are urged to study the sample programs and exercise
solutions before starting work on this mini-project assessment.

## Background:
One of the first arcade games to be based on a real space
mission and using pseudo-realistic physics was Lunar
Lander (Atari, 1979).
In the game, players control a space vehicle as it makes its
approach to the surface of the moon. By pressing various
keyboard keys, the vehicle can be rotated right or left, or
the main rocket engine fired (to decelerate the vehicle).
Fuel is limited, so the player has to carefully manage use
of the main engine. Points are scored by landing on various
landing zones, but the vehicle must have horizontal and
vertical velocity below certain acceptable limits or it is
destroyed. Similarly, attempting to land outside a landing
zone results in a crash. A successful landing triggers an award of points, and a new landing
mission (with landing zones in new, random locations).
